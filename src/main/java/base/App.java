Exercise 2 - Counting the Number of Characters
Create a program that prompts for an input string and displays
 output that shows the input string and the number of characters the string contains.

------Example Output------
What is the input string? Homer
Homer has 5 characters.

-------Constraints-------
Be sure the output contains the original string.
Use a single output statement to construct the output.
Use a built-in function of the programming language to determine the length of the string.

------Challenges-------
If the user enters nothing, state that the user must enter something into the program.

Implement this program using a graphical user interface and update the character
counter every time a key is pressed.

If your language doesnâ€™t have a particularly friendly GUI library, try doing this exercise with HTML
and JavaScript instead.
